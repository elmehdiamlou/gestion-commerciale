## üìå Gestion Commerciale is a desktop application.

**Gestion Commerciale** is a desktop application that I made with C# using ADO.NET to connect and work with database. The application allows users to manage customers and products, place orders for customers and view orders from selected customers with their products.\
C# is an object-oriented programming language, marketed by Microsoft since 2002 and intended for development on the Microsoft .NET platform.\
ADO.NET provides a rich set of components for creating distributed, data-sharing applications. It is an integral part of the .NET Framework, providing access to relational, XML, and application data.
